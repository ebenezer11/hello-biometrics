# hello-biometrics
A repository for my Raspberry Pi projects in M1.
My name is Antwi Kwaku Ebenenezer. I completed my 4 year degeree program in Computer Science in Ghana. I moved to France to study a Licence 3 in Computer Vision and Robotics at the University of Burgundy, Le Creusot campus. After That I moved here for the masters in Biometrics because I am very interested in the application of biometrics in security. I hope to improve my programming abilities and be able to make an application with the Raspberry Pi.
